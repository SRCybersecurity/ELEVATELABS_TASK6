# ELEVATE_LABS_TASK6
Evaluate Password Strength <br></br>
***Task: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength.***

**Objective:** Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.  <br>
**Tools:** Online free password strength checkers (https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/, https://passwordmeter.com).  <br>
**Deliverables:** Report showing password strength results and explanation along with the scanned results screenshots are uploaded in this repository.

**Following step by step task with examples where needed**. <br></br>
1. Create Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity** <br>
•	Let’s generate passwords with different levels of complexity:

Password	Description
| Password          | Description                        |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `apple`           | Simple: lowercase          |
| `apple123`        | Simple: lowercase + numbers         |
| `Apple123`        | Adds uppercase                      |
| `Apple@123`       | Adds a symbol                       |
| `Appl3@2025!`     | More complex, slight substitution   |
| `Ap1le@234S5&#`   | High complexity, mix of everything  |
| `xY9@jF!3R#u2L&wT`| Random complex password             |

   <br></br>

2. Passwords with Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Symbols, and Length Variations <br>
 <br>•	Lowercase only: apple
 <br>•	Lowercase + Numbers: apple123
 <br>•	Mixed Case + Numbers: Apple123
 <br>•	Mixed + Numbers + Symbols: Apple@123
 <br>•	Complex Mixed + Numbers + Symbols: Appl3@2025!
 <br>•	Full complexity + longer length: Ap1le@234S5&#
 <br>•	Random complex password: xY9@jF!3R#u2L&wT

3. Test Each Password on a Password Strength Checker
 <br>Tool Used:
 <br>•	https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/
 <br>•	https://passwordmeter.com/  <br>
 <br>   Run each password through the given site and noted the given password’s security measures.
 <br>   •	Lowercase only: apple
 <br>   •	Lowercase + Numbers: apple123 
 <br>   •	Mixed Case + Numbers: Apple123
 <br>   •	Mixed + Numbers + Symbols: Apple@123
 <br>   •	Complex Mixed + Numbers + Symbols: Appl3@2025!
 <br>   •	Full complexity + longer length: Ap1le@234S5&#
 <br>   •	Random complex password: xY9@jF!3R#u2L&wT <br></br>

4. Scores and Feedback from the Tool  <br> </br>

| Password           | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback                            |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `apple`            | Instantly            | Very Weak, lacks numbers, symbols   |
| `apple123`         | Few seconds          | Too common, lacks symbols           |
| `Apple123`         | A few minutes        | Add special characters              |
| `Apple@123`        | A few hours          | Could be longer                     |
| `Appl3@2025!`      | A few hundred years  | Strong                              |
| `Ap1le@234S5&#`    | Million years        | Strong                              |
| `xY9@jF!3R#u2L&wT` | Trillion Years       | Excellent                           |

5. Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords <br>
 <br> From the testing and feedback:
 <br> •	Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
 <br> •	Avoid dictionary words and common patterns.
 <br> •	Make it at least 12–16 characters long.
 <br> •	Don’t reuse passwords across multiple sites.
 <br> •	Use a passphrase or random words for memorability and complexity.
 <br> •	Consider using a password manager to store and generate secure passwords. 
---
 6. Tips Learned from the Evaluation  <br>
 <br> Tips:
 <br> •	The longer the password, the better (exponential increase in security).
 <br> •	Complexity (mixed characters) drastically increases security.
 <br> •	Substituting numbers for letters (e.g., 3 for e) helps a little but isn’t foolproof.
 <br> •	Random character placement is more effective than predictable patterns.
 <br> •	Passphrases like AppleFruitIsNotForFree! are both strong and memorable.

7. Common Password Attacks  <br>
  **Brute Force Attack** 
   <br>  •	Tries every possible combination.
   <br>  •	Longer and more complex passwords take exponentially longer to crack.
   <br>  •	Tools: Hydra, John the Ripper, Hashcat <br></br>

    **Dictionary Attack**
   <br>•	Uses a list of common passwords or words.
   <br>•	Faster than brute force.
   <br>•	Can be defeated with unique and non-dictionary passwords. <br> </br>

   **Credential Stuffing**
   <br>•	Uses stolen username/passwords from breaches.
   <br>•	Emphasizes the importance of not reusing passwords. 
---

8. Password Complexity Affects Security Summary:  <br>
 <br>•	Password complexity greatly enhances security. 
 <br>•	Simple passwords using common words or patterns are vulnerable to dictionary and brute-force attacks. 
 <br>•	Complexity achieved by including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and longer lengths dramatically increases the time and computing power required to crack a password. 
 <br>•	Unique, unpredictable passwords are best defence against modern password cracking techniques.
